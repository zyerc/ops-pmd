The atoc.c code is used to convert ASCII (HEX) data into binary data.

It's specifically written to convert the hexadecimal representation of SFP/QSFP
a0 data into a binary representation.

The sum.c code is used to verify the checksums embedded in a0 data. It can be
used to verify that the atoc conversion has worked properly.

This directory contains several example files which can be used with test
infrastructure to populate simulated SFP/QSFP modules. The *.bin file should
be used for this purpose.
